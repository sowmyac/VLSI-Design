1) Simulation in Xilinx ISE (ISE Project Navigator)
	a) File -> New Project
	b) Project -> Add source, Add source code "ALU.v" and testbench code 
	   "ALU_testbench.v" to the project created. 
	c) Simulation -> ISim Simulator -> Simulate Behavioral Model

2) To open schematic and layout of the design in Cadence's virtuoso (130nm Process Technology) 	
	"project6" is the library containing all the required cell views.
